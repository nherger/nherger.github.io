I am an Adoption Manager for Data and Analytics within Axpo [Trading & Sales](https://www.axpo.com/group/en/business-areas/energy-trading-and-sales.html). 

Before joining Axpo I was a Director of Model Stewardship at Thomson Reuters, based in Switzerland. In this role, I was leading a globally-distributed, talented group of individuals. We oversaw all AI/ML-driven  solutions developed across the enterprise, and translated internal policies and standards into effective controls and scalable implementation practices. On a daily basis my team supported model developing and consuming teams with the responsible development and use of this technology. We covered topics such as model registration, documentation, risk assessment, monitoring, and ethics-related controls.

Before taking on a managerial role, I was a Senior Data Scientist at [Thomson Reuters Labs](https://innovation.thomsonreuters.com/en/labs.html). My work was mainly related to Natural Language Processing and human-centric AI.

I completed both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at ETH Zürich in Environmental Sciences, specialising in Climate Science. I then moved to Sydney, Australia, to pursue a PhD degree at UNSW in Climate Science at the [Climate Change Research Centre](http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/ccrc-team/students/nadja-herger).

I have led and co-authored a range of peer-reviewed articles which are published in scientific journals. The full list can be found [here](publications.md). I also had the pleasure to present at various academic and industry conferences, events and meetups. Topics include AI Ethics (incl. Explainable AI) and use cases of Natural Language Processing in industry. A list of speaking engagements can be found [here](speaking.md).  

In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my dog, [photography](https://500px.com/nadja_herger), hiking, and sewing.
