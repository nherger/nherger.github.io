I am a Data and Model Ethics Manager at Thomson Reuters, based in Switzerland. In this role, I am supporting the organisation on its journey to become a leader in the ethical use of data and models (incl. AI). This includes topics such as fairness/bias, Explainable AI, and privacy.

Before taking on the manager role, I was a Senior Data Scientist at [Thomson Reuters Labs](https://innovation.thomsonreuters.com/en/labs.html). My work was mainly related to Natural Language Processing and human-centric AI.

I completed both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at ETH Zürich in Environmental Sciences, specialising in Climate Science. I then moved to Sydney, Australia, to pursue a PhD degree at UNSW in Climate Science at the [Climate Change Research Centre](http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/ccrc-team/students/nadja-herger).

I have led and co-authored a range of peer-reviewed articles which are published in scientific journals. The full list can be found [here](publications.md). I also had the pleasure to present at various academic and industry conferences, events and meetups. Topics include AI Ethics (incl. Explainable AI) and use cases of Natural Language Processing in industry. A list of speaking engagements can be found [here](speaking.md).  

In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my dog, [photography](https://500px.com/nadja_herger), hiking, and sewing.
