I am a Senior Data Scientist at [Thomson Reuters Labs](https://innovation.thomsonreuters.com/en/labs.html), based in Switzerland. My expertise is in Natural Language Processing and human-centric AI. I'm passionate about the use of technology for social good and AI Ethics (incl. fairness, and Explainable AI).

I completed both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at ETH Zürich in Environmental Sciences, specialising in Climate Science. I then moved to Sydney, Australia, to pursue a PhD degree at UNSW in Climate Science at the [Climate Change Research Centre](http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/ccrc-team/students/nadja-herger).

I have led and co-authored a range of peer-reviewed articles which are published in scientific journals. The full list can be found [here](publications.md). I also had the pleasure to present at various academic and industry conferences, events and meetups. Topics include AI Ethics (incl. Explainable AI) and use cases of Natural Language Processing in industry. A list of speaking engagements can be found [here](speaking.md).  

In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my dog, [photography](https://500px.com/nadja_herger), hiking, and sewing.
