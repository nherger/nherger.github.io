My partner Oliver Ang√©lil and I created a Python crash course for climate scientists.

<!--more-->

With the help of example code, learn how to: read in netCDF files; generate maps; calculate area-weighted averages; plot time series; write list-comprehensions (i.e. more compact loops); and use CDO within Python using the CDO Python module.

You can access the course <a href="https://oliverangelil.github.io/posts/crash-course" target="_blank">here</a>.
